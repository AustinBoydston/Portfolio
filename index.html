   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <div class = "textContainer"><h3>My journey with technology began at a young age with devices like the Game Boy Advanced and PlayStation 1. I went to university and obtained dual degrees in computer science and mathematics graduating in the fall of 2022. Since then I have worked as a programming and math educator teaching others while developing my skills. Below are my implementations from selected projects I have used to teach my students or up skill my abilities.</h3></div>

   
    <h1 id="mazeTitle">Maze Generator</h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
        <h3>This project was for my students begginer programming final project. They were to make a maze game that generates a maze then allows the player to navigate throught it with the arrow keys until they reach the exit square. Below is a clip of my solution running. If you would like to download this and try it for yourself you can do so at <a clas="githubMazeLink" href="https://github.com/AustinBoydston/GeneratedMazeGame" target ="_blank">This Link.</a>The biggest lesson I took away from this project was how to integrate the pygame libray for video game development and how to design a flexible maze generation algorithm.</h3>

    <h1>Minecraft Stronghold Finder</h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
        <h3>This project was a fun challenge to build a program that can calculate the location of the stronghold in minecraft using the method of triangulation. I built it out in python quickly and wanted to explore python-web integrations and stumbled upon the Brython project. I built out a static site on github pages and inserted my python code with brython as a backend. You can try this project out<a class = "InTextLink" href="https://austinboydston.github.io/MinecraftStrongholdFinder/" target="_blank">here.</a> I am very pleased with the result and will take Brython with me as a tool I can use anytime it is more cost effective to run rather than a complete rewrite in Javascript.</h3>

    <h1> Asteroids Like Space Game </h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
        <h3>This is a game I developed using game maker studio engine that you can download <a href="https://workupload.com/file/mMmvfUUTmBK" target="_blank">here</a>(The password is spacegame). I have used the experience from this game to teach students how to create similar 2d games in godot. All the art and music was my own work and I gained an appreciation for working in an engine to build games. What I learned most here was how to approach game frame rendering, collision, and timing in a live simulation. Godot is a very similar engine that's free and my students have loved working with it.</h3>

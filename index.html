   <h2>About Me</h2>
   <div class = "textContainer"><h3>My journey with technology began at a young age with devices like the Game Boy Advanced and PlayStation 1. I went to university and obtained dual degrees in computer science and mathematics graduating in the fall of 2022. Since then I have worked as a programming and math educator teaching others while developing my skills to start my career in tech. Below are my implementations from selected projects I have used to teach my students or up skill my abilities.</h3></div>

   
    <h1>Maze Generator</h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
        <h3>This project was for my students begginer programming students final project. They were to make a maze game that generates a maze then allows the player to navigate throught it with the arrow keys until they reach the exit square. Below is a clip of my solution running. If you would like to download this and try it for yourself you can do so at <span clas="githubMazeLink">This Link</span>. The biggest lesson I took away from this project was how to integrate the pygame libray for video game development and how to design a flexible maze generation algorithm.</h3>

    <h1>Minecraft Stronghold Finder</h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
        <h3>This project was a fun challenge to build a program that can calculate the location of the strong hold in minecraft using the method of triangulation. I built it out in python quickly and wanted to explore python-web integrations and stumbled upon the Brython project. I built out a static site on github pages and inserted my python code with brython as a backend. You can try this project out<a class = "InTextLink" href="https://austinboydston.github.io/MinecraftStrongholdFinder/" target="_blank">here.</a> I am very pleased with the result and will take Brython with me as a tool I can use anytime it is more cost effective to run rather than a complete rewrite in Javascript.</h3>

    <h1> Asteroids Like Space Game </h1>
    <div class="textContainer">
        <h3>This one is actually two for one. The left clip is from a game I developed during college, and the one on the right is from my first teaching job where I taught my student how to make games using the Godot Engine. The left game was built with Game Maker studio. All the art and music was my own work and I gained an appreciation for working in an engine to build games. What I learned most here was how to approach game frame rendering and timming in a live simulation.</h3>

    <h1>Austin Boydston Portfolio</h1>
    <div>As a Programming and Mathematics Educator, I have been blessed with the opportunity to share my passion with a wide range of students. This has naturally led to a slow accumulation of custom projects and other educational materials I have created over the years and is the reason for the creation of this portfolio to act as a central repository for all my content. Feel free to browse around!</div>
